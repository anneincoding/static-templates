				<h2>Great White Sharks</h2>
				<h5>Cheese, tomato, mushrooms, onions.</h5>
				<p>The Great White is a large lamniform shark found in coastal surface waters in all major oceans. Some are known to have exceeded 6 metres (20 ft) in length and 2,268 kilograms (5,000 lb) in weight. This shark reaches maturity at around 15 years of age and can have a life span of over 30 years. The great white shark is one of the primary predators of marine mammals. It is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine animals including fish and seabirds. It is the only known surviving species of its genus. The International Union Conservation of Nature treats the great white shark as vulnerable. Despite its scary reputation, in reality, humans are not the preferred prey of the Great White Shark, but just to be on the safe side we’ll be diving in cages when we meet these guys in Cape Town.</p>

				<h2>Tiger Sharks</h2>
				<h5>Galeocerdo cuvier</h5>
				<p>This is a species of requiem shark found in many tropical temperate waters. Its name comes from the dark stripes down its body which resemble a tiger's stripes, these fade as the shark matures. It is the only member of the genus Galeocerdo. The Tiger Shark is one of the largest sharks on earth, growing to over 5 m (16 ft) and weighing up to 635kg (1400lbs). The tiger shark is a solitary, mostly nocturnal hunter. Its diet includes a wide variety of prey, ranging from crustaceans, fish, seals, birds, squid, turtles, and sea snakes; to dolphins and even other smaller sharks. The tiger shark is killed for its fins, flesh, and liver causing a drop in population sizes in some areas. Tiger sharks are considered a near threatened species as a result according to International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p>

				<h2>Bull Sharks</h2>
				<h5>Carcharhinus leucas</h5>
				<p>Also known as the Zambezi shark, the Bull Shark is commonly found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers. It is known for its aggressive nature and predilection for warm shallow water, including rivers and estuaries. Bull sharks are the only sharks able to survive for long periods in freshwater, they can travel very far inland up rivers (in the US one was found in to have travelled up the Mississippi into Indiana). Bull Sharks grow up to 3.4m long. The Bull Shark is sometimes caught for its skin, flesh and liver oil, but the fins are now the product most in demand. Recreational fishing is also responsible for decline in numbers. Bull Sharks are also exploited by large aquariums as they are good for public display and survive in captivity. Its presence in freshwater environments also makes it vulnerable to threats. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature rates Bull Sharks as near-threatened.</p>

				<h2>Whale Sharks</h2>
				<h5>Rhincodon typus</h5>
				<p>Whale sharks are slow-moving filter feeders and the largest fish species. The largest confirmed individual was 12.65 metres (41.50 ft) long and weighed more than 21.5 tonnes (47,000 lb). However, claims of individuals over 14 metres (46 ft) long and weighing at least 30 tonnes (66,000 lb) are not uncommon. The whale shark is by far the largest living non-mammalian vertebrate, rivaling many of the largest dinosaurs in weight. It is the sole member of its genus. The species originated approximately 60 million years ago. The whale shark is found in tropical and warm oceans and lives in the open sea with a lifespan of about 70 years. Although whale sharks have very large mouths, they feed mainly, on plankton. They have also been witnessed feeding on schools of small fish or the clouds of eggs and sperm which result from fish spawning.</p>

				<h2>Dusky Sharks</h2>
				<h5>Carcharhinus obscurus</h5>
				<p>Dusky Sharks are a species of requiem shark living in tropical and warm-temperate seas worldwide. They can be found from the coast to the outer continental shelf and have been recorded from a depth of 400m (1,300 ft). Seasonal migration can cover hundreds to thousands of kilometres. One of the largest members of its genus, it reaches 4.2m (14 ft) in length and 347kg (765 lb) in weight. Dusky Sharks are one of the slowest-growing and latest-maturing sharks, not reaching adulthood until around 20 years of age. This slow reproductive rate makes it very vulnerable to human-caused population depletion. It is killed for its fins, used in shark fin soup, and for its meat, skin, and liver oil, as well as for recreational fishing. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as Near Threatened worldwide and Vulnerable off the eastern United States, where populations have dropped to 15–20% of 1970s levels.</p>

				<h2>Spotted Ragged Toot Sharks (Raggies)</h2>
				<h5>Carcharias taurus</h5>
				<p>Also known as the sand tiger shark, grey nurse shark or blue-nurse sand tiger shark, this is a species that inhabits coastal waters worldwide living close to shorelines. Despite its fearsome appearance and strong swimming ability, it is relatively placid and slow-moving. Raggies can reach over 3m (11ft) in length. They are grey with reddish-brown spots on their backs. Their diet consists of bony fish, crustaceans, squid, and skates. Unlike other sharks, the sand tiger can gulp air from the surface, allowing it to be easily suspended in the water column. Raggies are categorized as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List. It is the most widely kept shark in public aquariums owing to its large size and tolerance for captivity.

					<h2>Blue Sharks</h2>
					<h5>Prionace glauca</h5>
					<p>Another species of requiem shark, found in deep waters in the world's temperate and tropical oceans. Blue sharks migrate long distances, for example from New England to South America. Although generally lethargic, they can move very quickly. They feed primarily on small fish and squid, although they can take larger prey. Blue sharks often school segregated by sex and size, and this behavior has led to their nickname "wolves of the sea". They can grow to 3.8m (12.5 ft) and can weigh up to 204 kg (450 lb). The highest reported weight was 391 kilograms (860 lb) . It is estimated that 10 to 20 million Blue Sharks are killed each year as a result of fishing. The flesh is edible, but not widely sought after; it is eaten fresh, dried, smoked and salted and diverted for fishmeal. The skin is used for leather, the fins for shark-fin soup and the liver for oil.</p>

					<h2>Bronze Sharks</h2>
					<h5>Carcharhinus brachyurus</h5>
					<p>Also known as the copper shark or narrowtooth shark, this requiem shark is the only member of its genus found mostly at temperate latitudes. It can be found in a range of habitats from rivers and estuaries, to shallow bays and harbors, to offshore waters 100 m (330 ft) deep or more. They reach 3.3 m (11 ft) long, and are characterized by narrow, hook-shaped upper teeth, lack of a prominent ridge between the dorsal fins, and plain bronze coloration. It is a fast-swimming predator that often hunts in large groups, utilizing their numbers to their advantage. Off South Africa, this species associates closely with the annual Sardine Run. It is extremely slow-growing, with males and females not reaching maturity until 13–19 and 19–20 years of age respectively. Bronze Whalers are widely killed for food. It is very susceptible to population depletion due to its low growth and reproductive rates. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Near Threatened.</p>

					<h2>Manta Rays</h2>
					<h5>Reef Manta Ray (Manta alfredi) and the Giant Oceanic Manta Ray (Manta birostris)</h5>
					<p>Mantas are the largest rays in the world. They are typically found in tropical and subtropical waters, although oceanic manta rays can be found in temperate waters. Oceanic mantas reach at least 7m (23 ft) in width and there are anecdotal reports of even larger specimens, while reef mantas reach about 5.5m (18 ft) in width. The average weight is 1,300 kilograms (2,900 lb). They are generally dark on the upper surface with pale undersides; individuals have a unique pattern of blotches and scars that can be used to identify them. Mantas have a tail similar to stingrays, but they have lost their stinger and are harmless to divers. Manta rays are subject to a number of threats. They must swim constantly in order to flush oxygen-rich water over their gills, making them vulnerable to entanglement and suffocation. They cannot swim backwards, and are prone to being caught in trailing fishing line, nets, and even loose mooring lines. Targeted fisheries for manta rays are even more harmful. In the last decade, demand for manta gill rakers—the tough, cartilaginous structures protecting the gills and straining plankton from the water—has been growing in Traditional Chinese Medicine practices, although the remedy calling for dried gill rakers has not been shown to be traditional. As a result of growing demand in Asia, targeted fisheries have developed around the world. Each year, thousands of manta rays—primarily oceanic mantas—are being caught and killed purely for their gill rakers. Intense, targeted fisheries for manta rays have long-term detrimental effects, due to the low reproductive rates and long lifespans of mantas. In 2011 Mantas became strictly protected in international waters after inclusion in the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), an international treaty organization concerned with conserving migratory species and habitats on a global scale. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) declared giant manta rays as ’vulnerable with an elevated risk of extinction’ in November 2011.</p>

					<h2>Humpback Whales</h2>
					<h5>Megaptera novaeangliae</h5>
					<p>These are a species of baleen whale. Adults range in length from 12–16 metres (39–52 ft) and weigh approximately 36,000 kilograms (79,000 lb). The largest ever recorded specimen 19m (62 ft) long and had pectoral fins measuring 6m (20 ft) each. It is an acrobatic animal, often breaching and slapping the water. The humpback whale lifespan ranges from 45–100 years. Males produce a complex song, which lasts for 10 to 20 minutes and is repeated for hours at a time. The purpose of the song is not yet clear, although it appears to have a role in mating. Found in oceans and seas around the world, humpback whales typically migrate up to 25,000 kilometres (16,000 mi) each year. Humpbacks feed only in summer, in polar waters, and migrate to tropical or sub-tropical waters to breed and give birth in the winter. During the winter, humpbacks fast and live off their fat reserves. The species' diet consists mostly of krill and small fish. Like other large whales, the humpback was and is a target for the whaling industry. Due to over-hunting, its population fell by an estimated 90% before a whaling moratorium was introduced in 1966. Stocks have since partially recovered; however, entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships, and noise pollution also remain concerns. There are at least 80,000 humpback whales worldwide.</p>

					<h2>Sardine run</h2>
					<h5></h5>
					<p>The sardine run of southern Africa takes place from May until July when billions of sardines (Southern African pilchard) spawn in the cool waters of the Agulhas Bank and move northward along the east coast of South Africa. A current of cold water heads north from the Agulhas Bank up to Mozambique where it then leaves the coastline and goes further east into the Indian Ocean. In terms of biomass, it is estimated that the sardine run could rival East Africa's great wildebeest migration. However, little is known of the phenomenon. It is believed that the water temperature has to drop below 21°C in order for the migration to take place, meaning occasionally it does not occur. In 2003, the sardines failed to 'run' for the third time in 23 years. Recent years have seen good ‘runs’. The shoals are often more than 7 km long, 1.5 km wide and 30 meters deep and are clearly visible from spotter planes or from the surface. Their sheer numbers create a feeding frenzy along the coastline, making it a great time to observe a host of predators. Dolphins are largely responsible for rounding up the sardines into bait balls. These bait balls can be 10–20 metres in diameter and extend to a depth of 10 metres. The bait balls are short lived and seldom last longer than 10 minutes. Once the sardines are rounded up, sharks (primarily the Bronze Whaler, but also Dusky Shark, Spotted Ragged Tooth Shark, Blacktip Reef Shark, Spinner Shark and Bull Shark), game fish (including Shad/Elf a.k.a. Bluefish, King Mackerel, various kingfish species, Garrick, Geelbek and Eastern Little Tuna) and sea birds (including the Cape Gannet, cormorants, terns and gulls) take advantage of the opportunity to feed. Cape Fur Seals also follow the shoals up the Eastern Cape coastline as far as Port St Johns. The Sardine Run is an important event for local people on the coast of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. For local fishermen this is a time to secure bait for the year ahead. Fresh sardines are a sought after seasonal delicacy, with several local recipes having been developed to prepare the fish, including various curries developed by local people of Indian descent, as well as a method of deep frying the sardines by local Anglo-Africans. In the past, businesses and schools would close if a beaching of sardines occurred locally, so that people could rush to the beach and secure their share of the spoils. The excitement of the event often leads to what is known locally as "Sardine Fever". For more information check out The Sardine Run Association www.thesardinerunassociation.org</p>
